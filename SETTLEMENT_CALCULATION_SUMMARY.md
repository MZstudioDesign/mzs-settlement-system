# MZS Settlement System - Core Calculation Engine Implementation

## Overview

I have successfully analyzed and implemented a comprehensive settlement calculation engine for the MZS Settlement System that addresses all the critical gaps found in the existing implementation and follows the exact MZS Studio business requirements.

## 🔍 Analysis Results

### Critical Gaps Identified in Existing Code:
- ❌ **Incorrect Business Logic**: Old calculator didn't follow MZS Studio formula (T → B → base → designer share)
- ❌ **Missing Fee Calculations**: No implementation of ad fees (10%), program fees (3%), or channel fees
- ❌ **Missing Multiple Revenue Sources**: No support for contacts, feeds, team tasks, or mileage
- ❌ **Incomplete Designer Distribution**: No support for multiple designers with individual percentages
- ❌ **Missing Validation**: No comprehensive business rule validation
- ❌ **Limited Test Coverage**: No test scenarios for edge cases

### ✅ What Was Successfully Implemented:

## 🏗️ Core Settlement Calculation Engine

### 1. **Complete Business Logic Implementation** (`src/lib/settlement-calculations.ts`)

**Core MZS Studio Formula:**
```
T (gross_amount) → B (net_B = T / 1.1) → base (B + discount) →
fees (ad 10% + program 3% + channel %) →
designer_amount (base * 0.40 * percent) →
bonus (designer_amount * bonus_pct) →
withholding 3.3%
```

**Key Functions:**
- `calculateNetFromGross()` - VAT removal (T → B)
- `calculateProjectFees()` - All fee calculations from net amount
- `calculateDesignerSettlement()` - Individual designer calculations with bonus
- `calculateProjectSettlement()` - Complete project settlement with multiple designers
- `calculateContactSettlement()` - Contact event settlements (1000/1000/2000)
- `calculateFeedSettlement()` - Feed event settlements (400/1000)
- `calculateTeamTaskSettlement()` - Team task settlements
- `calculateMileageSettlement()` - Mileage settlements

### 2. **Business Rules Constants:**
```typescript
SETTLEMENT_RULES = {
  VAT_RATE: 0.10,               // 10% VAT
  DESIGNER_BASE_RATE: 0.40,     // 40% to designers
  WITHHOLDING_TAX_RATE: 0.033,  // 3.3% withholding
  AD_FEE_RATE: 0.10,           // 10% ad fee
  PROGRAM_FEE_RATE: 0.03,      // 3% program fee
  CONTACT_AMOUNTS: { INCOMING: 1000, CHAT: 1000, GUIDE: 2000 },
  FEED_AMOUNTS: { BELOW3: 400, GTE3: 1000 },
  BONUS_MIN: 0, BONUS_MAX: 20   // 0-20% bonus range
}
```

### 3. **Comprehensive Validation System**

**Validation Functions:**
- `validateDesignerPercentages()` - Ensures designer percentages sum to exactly 100%
- `validateBonusPercentage()` - Validates 0-20% bonus range
- `validateProjectAmounts()` - Validates gross amounts and discount limits
- Real-time validation with detailed error messages

**Validation Rules:**
- Designer percentages must sum to 100% (within 0.01% tolerance)
- Bonus percentages: 0-20% range
- Gross amounts: Must be positive
- Discount amounts: Cannot exceed net amount

## 💰 Enhanced Currency Utilities (`src/lib/currency.ts`)

### New Features Added:
- `formatPercentage()` - Format percentages with one decimal place
- `formatKoreanUnits()` - Korean unit formatting (만, 억)
- `formatTaxBreakdown()` - Tax-inclusive/exclusive breakdowns
- `formatAmountBoth()` - Both standard and Korean formats
- `formatSettlementSummary()` - Complete settlement formatting
- `safeParseCurrency()` - Safe currency string parsing
- `calculateCompoundAmounts()` - Multiple amount calculations

### Enhanced Formatting:
```typescript
// Korean units: "15만원", "1억2천만원"
formatKoreanUnits(150000) // "15만원"

// Tax breakdown with rates
formatTaxBreakdown(1100000) // { inclusive: "₩1,100,000", exclusive: "₩1,000,000", tax: "₩100,000" }

// Comprehensive settlement summary
formatSettlementSummary(grossT, netB, designerTotal, companyTotal)
```

## 🧪 Comprehensive Test Scenarios (`src/lib/settlement-test-scenarios.ts`)

### Test Categories:
1. **Normal Business Cases**: Standard projects, typical scenarios
2. **Edge Cases**: Zero amounts, very large amounts, rounding issues
3. **Validation Tests**: Invalid percentages, bonus limits
4. **Error Handling**: Negative amounts, invalid inputs
5. **Real-world Scenarios**: Kmong projects, corporate projects, freelance work
6. **Performance Tests**: Multiple designers, precision tests

### Test Coverage:
- **Basic Calculations**: 4+ scenarios covering standard project settlements
- **Contact Events**: INCOMING/CHAT/GUIDE with correct amounts
- **Feed Events**: BELOW3/GTE3 with proper withholding
- **Validation**: 5+ validation scenarios for business rules
- **Edge Cases**: 7+ edge cases including zero amounts, rounding
- **Error Handling**: 4+ error scenarios with proper error messages
- **Real-world Examples**: 3+ realistic project scenarios

## 🎛️ Updated Calculator Component (`src/components/calculator/settlement-calculator.tsx`)

### Complete Redesign Features:
1. **Multi-Designer Support**: Add/remove designers with individual percentages and bonuses
2. **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on validation errors
3. **Auto-Percentage Adjustment**: "100% 자동조정" button to normalize percentages
4. **Channel Fee Support**: Slider for channel fees (크몽 21%, 계좌입금 0%)
5. **Discount Support**: Separate input for discount amounts
6. **Comprehensive Results Display**:
   - Basic calculation breakdown (T → B → base)
   - Fee calculations (ad, program, channel)
   - Individual designer settlements with withholding
   - Final summary with percentages
   - Visual percentage indicators

### UI Improvements:
- **Error Display**: Clear validation error messages
- **Real-time Calculations**: Debounced real-time updates
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded results (green for designers, red for fees, blue for company)
- **Korean Business Terms**: Uses proper Korean terminology (기준금액, 원천징수, etc.)

## 🔧 Integration Points

### Database Integration:
- Compatible with existing `SettlementCalculation` and `FeeCalculation` types
- Works with `DesignerAllocation` interfaces
- Ready for `settlement_items` table with snapshot storage

### API Integration:
- Functions return structured data ready for database storage
- Snapshot-compatible for historical rule preservation
- Supports all revenue sources (projects, contacts, feeds, team tasks, mileage)

### Component Integration:
- Drop-in replacement for existing calculator
- Maintains similar props interface but with enhanced features
- Ready for real-time preview calculations

## 📊 Business Logic Accuracy

### Core Formula Implementation:
```typescript
// Example: 1,100,000원 프로젝트 (크몽 21% 수수료)
const grossAmount = 1100000;  // T (부가세 포함)
const netB = 1000000;         // B (순금액, T/1.1)
const baseAmount = 1000000;   // base (B + discount)
const fees = {
  adFee: 100000,             // 10% of B
  programFee: 30000,         // 3% of B
  channelFee: 210000         // 21% of B (크몽)
};
const totalFees = 340000;    // 34% total fees

// 디자이너 (60% 지분, 10% 보너스)
const designerAmount = 240000;    // base * 0.4 * 0.6
const bonusAmount = 24000;        // designerAmount * 0.1
const beforeWithholding = 264000;
const withholdingTax = 8712;      // 264000 * 0.033
const afterWithholding = 255288;  // Final amount

// 회사 수익: 1,000,000 - 264,000 - 340,000 = 396,000
```
